# Pricing-American-Option-within-the-CRR-model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the pricing of American options using the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial model. The CRR model is widely used in derivatives pricing due to its intuitive and flexible framework. It models stock price movements as an up/down binomial process over discrete time steps. The pricing of American options is computed using backward induction, checking at each node whether early exercise is optimal.
